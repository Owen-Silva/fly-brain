# Experiments log

Every experiment gets: the date, what was changed, what happened, and whether
the result was validated (see PLAN.md Phase 6). Newest entries at the bottom.

## 2026-09-22: Phase 0, environment check
- **Changed:** Created the Python 3.13 environment and installed numpy, pandas,
  pyarrow, matplotlib, brian2 2.10.1, scipy, pytest.
- **Happened:** One simulated neuron with a steady input fired 8 times in
  200 ms, which matches the hand calculation (it takes about 24 ms to charge up
  to threshold each time, and 200 / 24 is about 8).
- **Note:** This machine has no C++ compiler, so Brian2 falls back to its
  slower pure-Python (numpy) mode. That is fine for small networks but may be
  too slow for the whole brain. Decision needed before Phase 3.
- **Validated:** Yes, as an install check only. Not a scientific result.
